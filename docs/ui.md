# UI

Two visual languages in this app, deliberately different — a kid-facing side
(auth pages, and presumably the future student experience) and a neutral
admin side. Don't cross-pollinate them without a reason recorded here.

## Kid-facing design system (`/login`, `/signup`)

**Visual reference:** [Wisdom Hatch](https://wisdomhatch.com) — the user's
existing connected brand site, referenced as tone/visual inspiration for this
kids-oriented LMS. No formal component-by-component design audit of that site
has been done; it's a named reference point, not a source to copy pixel-for-pixel.

**Token set** (`src/styles.css`, `:root` — locked; don't add colors outside
this set without updating this file):

| Token | Hex | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--cream` | `#FFF7EA` | Background/accent warm base |
| `--gold` | `#F2B233` | Primary CTA fill |
| `--gold-d` | `#C98A0D` | *Derived* — gold's candy-button shadow layer |
| `--teal` | `#2FA3A0` | Links |
| `--teal-d` | `#1E6765` | *Derived* |
| `--coral` | `#F0705A` | Error/destructive accents |
| `--coral-d` | `#D73014` | *Derived* — field/form error text |
| `--plum` | `#7A5FA8` | Accent (not yet used on auth pages) |
| `--plum-d` | `#57427A` | *Derived* |
| `--ink` | `#3A2A1A` | Text |

The four `-d` (dark/shadow) values weren't specified explicitly — derived at
~15pt-lower HSL lightness, same hue/saturation as their base. Treat as
provisional, easy to hand-tune later.

- **Typography:** Baloo 2 (`@fontsource-variable/baloo-2`, self-hosted),
  scoped to the `.auth-page` wrapper class only — does not override the
  app's global sans (Geist) elsewhere.
- **Card:** 26px border-radius, off-white surface (`#FFFEFB`, not pure
  white — distinguishes it from the page background), warm soft drop shadow
  (`rgba(58,42,26,…)`-based, not generic gray).
- **Primary button:** full-width pill (`border-radius: 999px`), `--gold`
  fill, "candy 3D" press effect — `box-shadow: 0 6px 0 var(--gold-d)` at
  rest, collapsing to `0 0 0 var(--gold-d)` with `translateY(6px)` on
  `:active`.
- **Page background:** pure white (`#FFFFFF`) specifically for `/login` and
  `/signup` — deliberate deviation from `--cream` as page backdrop (cream/
  gold/teal still used for accents and the button, just not this backdrop).
- **Links:** `--teal`, no underline by default, underline on `:hover`.

**Implemented on:** `/login` (`LoginPage.tsx`), `/signup` (`SignupPage.tsx`),
via shared `AuthCard`/`AuthField` in `src/components/auth/`. Not applied
anywhere else — the (future) student experience should probably use this,
the admin section deliberately does not.

## Admin visual language (`/admin/*`)

Neutral shadcn default: Geist font (from shadcn's Nova preset, same as the
rest of the app's non-auth chrome), neutral greys. Brand tokens appear only
as accents: gold `admin` / teal `student` role badges, coral for destructive
text/actions. Rationale: a dense data table reads better utilitarian, and
admins are a different audience than kids using the product. No `AdminLayout`
exists yet — each admin page currently renders standalone (see `state.md`).

## Component conventions

- shadcn components live in `src/components/ui/` (generated) — do not
  hand-edit generated files beyond the documented `eslint-disable` fix on
  `button.tsx`/`badge.tsx` (see `context.md` gotchas).
- Feature-specific UI is grouped by domain: `components/auth/`,
  `components/admin/`, `components/admin/users/`.
- Dialogs that need to reset form state on reopen: split the form into an
  inner component that mounts fresh per open (Radix unmounts dialog content
  on close), rather than a `useEffect` resetting state — the lint rule
  `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` will reject the effect version. See
  `EditUserDialog.tsx` / `CreateUserDialog.tsx` for the pattern.
- Installed shadcn components: button, table, dialog, alert-dialog,
  dropdown-menu, input, label, select, badge, skeleton, avatar, tooltip,
  sonner.
